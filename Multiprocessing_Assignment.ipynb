    "I. Multiprocessing: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",
    "    \n",
    "II. Why Multiprocessing is useful:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The multiprocessing package offers both local and remote concurrency, effectively side-stepping the Global Interpreter Lock by using subprocesses instead of threads. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Due to this, the multiprocessing module allows the programmer to fully leverage multiple processors on a given machine. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    It runs on both Unix and Windows."
