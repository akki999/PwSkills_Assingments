    "Ans: We use open() function to open a file. There are several modes for opening a file they are:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1. Read Only (‘r’) : Open text file for reading. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exists, raises the I/O error. This is also the default mode in which a file is opened.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2. Read and Write (‘r+’): Open the file for reading and writing. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Raises I/O error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3. Write Only (‘w’) : Open the file for writing. For the existing files, the data is truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Creates the file if the file does not exist.\n",

    "        5. Append Only (‘a’): Open the file for writing. The file is created if it does not exist. The handle is positioned at the end of the file. The data being written will be inserted at the end, after the existing data.\n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "    Why close() function is used:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Python file method close() closes the opened file. A closed file cannot be read or written any more. Any operation, which requires that the file be opened will raise a ValueError after the file has been closed. Calling close() more than once is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Python automatically closes a file when the reference object of a file is reassigned to another file. It is a good practice to use the close() method to close a file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Why is it important to close a file:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        It puts your program in the garbage collectors hands - though the file in theory will be auto closed, it may not be closed. Python 3 and Cpython generally do a pretty good job at garbage collecting, but not always, and other variants generally suck at it.\n",
    "\n",
    "        It can slow down your program. Too many things open, and thus more used space in the RAM, will impact performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "        For the most part, many changes to files in python do not go into effect until after the file is closed, so if your script edits, leaves open, and reads a file, it won't see the edits.\n",
    "\n",
    "        You could, theoretically, run in to limits of how many files you can have open.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Windows treats open files as locked, so legit things like AV scanners or other python scripts can't read the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "        It is sloppy programming (then again, I'm not exactly the best at remembering to close files myself!)"
