    "            \n",
    "            This command is used to add, delete or change columns in the existing table. \n",
    "            The user needs to know the existing table name and can do add, delete or modify tasks easily.\n",
    "            Example:\n",

    "    \n",

    "    Tables and formulas are helpful when communicating with data stored up to a point in a database through SQL, but a time comes when we actually want to execute some fairly complicated data interactions. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    We will also need the Data Manipulation Language in that situation. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    DML is a way to inform a database precisely what we want it to do by conversing in a manner that it has been built to comprehend from the scratch. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    When it comes to interacting within existing data, whether adding, moving, or deleting data, it provides a convenient way to do so.\n",
    "    \n",
    "II. Commands used in DML:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A. Insert:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        This command is used to enter the information or values into a row. \n",
    "        We can connect one or more records to a single table within a repository using this instruction. \n",
    "        This is often used to connect an unused tag to the documents.\n",
    "        Example:\n",
    "            INSERT INTO students ('stu_id' int, 'stu_name' varchar(20), 'city' varchar(20))\n",
    "            VALUES ('1', 'Nirmit', 'Gorakhpur');\n",
    "            \n",
    "    B. Update:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        This command is used to alter existing table records. Within a table, it modifies data from one or more records. \n",
    "        This command is used to alter the data which is already present in a table.\n",
    "        Example:\n",
    "            UPDATE students\n",
    "            SET due_fees = 20000\n",
    "            WHERE stu_name = 'Mini';\n",
    "        \n",
    "    C. Delete:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        It deletes all archives from a table. \n",
    "        This command is used to erase some or all of the previous table’s records. \n",
    "        If we do not specify the ‘WHERE’ condition then all the rows would be erased or deleted.\n",
    "        Example:\n",
    "            DELETE FROM students\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Data query language (DQL) is part of the base grouping of SQL sub-languages. \n",
    "    These sub-languages are mainly categorized into four categories: a data query language (DQL), a data definition language (DDL), a data control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language (DML). \n",
    "    Sometimes a transaction control language (TCL) is argued to be part of the sub-language set as well.\n",
    "    DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects. \n",

    "II. Select Command:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This command is used to get data out of the database. \n",
    "    It helps users of the database to access from an operating system, the significant data they need. \n",
    "    It sends a track result set from one tables or more.\n",
